Getting Kinan City PTC Account Generator up quick and dirty using $$

__Disclaimer__: This guide should be working as of 9/6/2022 and is my interpretation of a quick & dirty way just to get it running. I didn't really care much about security considerations, I just want it running & was willing to spend $$ to get it done. Costs are reflective on what I paid at the time.
